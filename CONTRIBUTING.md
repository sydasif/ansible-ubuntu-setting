# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this repository. Small, focused changes are easiest to review.

Guidelines:

- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes or feature requests.
- For code changes, create a branch from `main`, make small commits, and open a pull request.
- Include a brief description of manual verification steps or tests performed.

Code style:

- Keep YAML valid and idempotent for Ansible roles.
- Update `group_vars/Ubuntu.yml` only with example changes — keep secrets out of repo.
